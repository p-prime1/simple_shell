Handle cases where by a path isnt specified


Using Dereference the Pointer to char and check for '/'
If it isnt call a function that adds the path pass the argv as an argument

Function to create path (path_build(char **argv))
Function accepts pointer to strings
Since it isnt advisable to modify the environ var
Declare a pointer and assign a call to getenv("PATH") 
Using strtok tokenize the environ with :
Assign the result to a variable
Using the first argument constenate it
Then use access to check if the file exist if it doesnt tokenize again all this inside a loop
If the file exist return the concatenated path
Else return Null to signal that the command doesnt exist
